My AltSchool assesment 2 submission.

I noticed that Netlify has a custom 404 page, so the one I implemented doesn't seem to work when accessed there. When you clone and run on your local development server though, everything should work fine. 

### to run on local server
clone repo and open in code editor


type ` npm install ` to add dependencies


type `npm run dev` to run server
